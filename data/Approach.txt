A transfer learning methodology has been adopted using fast.ai library.

Initially, all the relevant libraries are imported.

The data is structured into train and test directories. Exploratory data analysis of the images is carried out. A general overview of the entire dataset is obtained.

Resnet architecture is used with a batch size of 32 for training purposes. Data augmentation is applied by putting size transforms with a zoom of 1.1. Validation data is 30% of the training dataset.

Initially, the resnet is preloaded with the weights of imagenet dataset. It is run with a learning rate of 1e-3 for 20 epochs. The model is then saved.

Then precompute is turned off to specify training for internal layers. Cycle len parameter is needed for cyclical learning rates. Then again after training, the model is saved.

The layers are then unfrozen. Different learning rates are supplied for last layers. The final model is saved.ssss
